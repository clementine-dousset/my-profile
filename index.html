        <h2>ESSEC 🎓</h2>
          <p>
            I joint in September 2020 the ESSEC <a href="https://www.essec.edu/fr/global-bba/" target="_blank">Global Bachelor of Business Administration</a>. I chose to start my cursus in the French Track at the Cergy campus.<br><br><img src="images/essec-campus.jpg" width="300px"> <br><br> Since the beginning of my studies, I have discovered different classes very different from those taught in high school. More particularly, I acquired new knowledge in accounting, marketing and statistics.

        <h2>Travel ✈️</h2>
          <p>
            Since my childhood, I have always liked to discover the world. I have had the chance to travel a lot, whether with my friends or my family. 🌍 <br>I also lived abroad for three years. With my family, we were expatriated in Sweden, to <a href="https://www.routard.com/guide/code_dest/stockholm.htm" target="_blank">Stockholm</a>. This experience allowed me to open up to new cultures, and also to develop my adaptability. 🇸🇪

        <h2>Volunteering 🤝</h2>
          <p>
            During the final year, with my music group, we took the initiative to organize a charity concert. We therefore discovered the steps leading to the organization of a show, and we had chosen the charity <a href="https://www.petitsprinces.com" target="_blank"> "Les Petits Princes"</a>to donate our profits to ⭐ <br>
            In addition, for three years, I have been volunteering at "La cène du Jeudi", a charity of distribution of meals and timeshare with people in difficult or precarious situations.

        <h2>Cooking 🍳</h2>
        <p>
          I have always loved cooking for my family and friends. I like to spend hours in the kitchen and try new recipes.
          I also like to try out new restaurants. <a href="https://chao-ba-restaurant.business.site" target="_blank">Here</a>, you will find the address of my favorite restaurant in Paris.
